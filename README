# MUby

A ruby MUD/MUSH/MUx engine currently part of a hobby project.

## Features

* Uses a simple SQLite DB to handle storage of user accounts and state
* Allows users to login and create a username and password
* Currently loads a basic world based off a png in the assets folder
* Supports commands such as directions, and basic chat

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you're using ruby 3.2.2 or later, and bundle install
1. Run `muby.rb` from the parent directory
1. You should be able to `telnet localhost 2019` to connect to the server

## TODO (i.e. very next on the list)

1. Refactor some older code and pull it out into the proper places for ease of maintaining
1. Implement short commands (such as `n` instead of `north` when it's not ambiguous)
1. Basic inventory and ability to manage equiptment
1. Something to fight! What's the point of an RPG with nothing to do
1. NPCs
1. Places for NPCs to show up (cities, towns, roads, etc.)
1. Procedular generation for general world text for biomes
1. Procedular generation for the world itself
